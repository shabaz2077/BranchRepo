# BranchRepo
Branch: In simple terms, a branch will allow making a "copy" while not affecting the original branch  Basically, you have your master branch and you don't want to mess anything up on that branch. However, you need to implement a new feature that works with the codebase on the master branch. A branch will allow making a "copy" while not affecting the original branch  For Example:  Consider you are working in a successful organization and you have released a product whose current version is  2.0. And your team decides to work on the next new feature. In this case, you will be creating a new branch for edifying the software product to version 3.0  without disturbing the existing version 2.0 whose bug fixes will be carried out in the former branch  You can find the contents of the branch by a switch between branches in GitHub.
